Our story begins with a pixel named "Bota(~)oAzulComQuintas-FeirasVerdesOTerceiro", but you can call him "You" (proncounced "U").
U was born to two pixerian parents who were portuguese enthusiasts in a far away village.
His parents were killed by a bi-sexual dragon, who also kidnapped his girlfriend who's name is "princess".
"princess" likes the color pink, she REALLY likes the color pink.
You have to save "princess".
